# RetroTaxi

This project aims to provide a simple, focused tool to help people run a team retrospective meeting online. Our solution will value:

* **A registrations-free experience** over formalized team management.
* **One-time use boards** over detailed historic archives.
* **Conversations** over analytical measurements or note taking.
* **A responsive web experience** over platform-specific apps.

## FAQ

**Why call it RetroTaxi?**  
I wanted a url where you could start typing `retro` and get the autocomplete. `.taxi` was just a available, simple and memorable top level domain.
