## Retro Board Tools

### Neatro

<https://www.neatro.io/>

Notable Features / Observations:

* Will track retros over time and help remind the group of incomplete action items.
* Can make Jira Tickets out of action items.
* Has built in vote timer to keep the meeting format on target.
* Lots of retro-style templates to choose from.
* Linked to helpful articles on each template style: <https://www.scrum-tips.com/agile/start-stop-continue-retrospective/>
* Requires registration to try out.
* No videos of the tool in action.

### retros.work

* Has video demo.
* Seems to be able to assign people from the meeting to the action items.
* Seems a bit feature heavy, analytical.

### goReflect

* Seems feature heavy to me. (Comments on cards, who voted, gif support.)

### TeamRetro

* Has a live demo with robots that help demonstrate the tool.
* Has cut animal avatars.
* I like that it hides the content until we move to the next step.
* Has a mostly Start/Stop/Continue but also has a column for "What puzzles us?"
* Grouping drag and drops feels clunky.
* Feels very form. 
* Feels like it is a lot of software.

### ScatterSpoke

* Does have a product demo, but it is hidden.

### Retrium

* No video.
* Has automated demo.
* I don't like how the UI is drastically different from phase to phase.

### EasyRetro (previously FunRetro)

* This is what we used to use, and I liked its simplicity.
