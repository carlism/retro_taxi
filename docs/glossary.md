# Glossary

It is useful for a project to define a glossary to help foster a ubiquitous language that unifies the users and creators of the product. What people call things and how they describe actions is important to simplifying the code and providing an intuitive user experience.

These terms should be constantly re-evaluated and refactored throughout the experience of the product. If a term is listed without a formal definition, feel free to add it as the term was most likely added to help start discovery around that term.

## Terms 

- **Actions** - During a discussion, the group may have an idea of how to improve the situation. These ides can be recorded as Actions within the board. It is usually a good idea to assign an Action to a participant to make sure someone can have responsibility for moving the idea forward.
- **Board; Retro Board** - The collaborative space where participants  post and later vote on discussion topics during a retro meeting. In a physical space this can be accomplished with sticky notes on a wall or whiteboard. RetroTaxi's goal is to provide a virtual space for this collaboration. 
- **Discussions** - When a topic is presented to the group, each participant is given an opportunity to react to said topic, gaining perspective from other members that sometimes results in the creation of Actions.
- **Facilitator** - A person running the retrospective meeting. Ideally the facilitator is a neutral party and spends their limited involvement eliciting deep thoughts from the participants.
- **Meeting Structure** - A retro meeting should have a mindful organization to it. Different teams will have their own variations but the core themes include a time to reflect, a time to discuss and a time to agree on how to move forward.
- **Retrospective** - A structured meeting that helps facilitate team reflection on what is working, what is not and what they want to do next. 
- **Vote, Voting** - A simply process to elicit and measure interest in a specific topic to maximize the collective groups use of time.
